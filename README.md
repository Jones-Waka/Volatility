# üß† Volatility3 Memory Analysis Framework Installation Lab

Volatility is an open-source memory forensics framework used to analyze memory dumps. It supports identifying the OS profile, listing active processes, visualizing parent-child relationships to detect suspicious behavior, identifying hidden or unlinked processes often caused by malware, inspecting network connections, detecting injected code, and even dumping process memory.

This guide documents how I installed [Volatility3](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3) on my homelab running Kali Linux.

For my hands-on analysis, I'll be using [MemLabs Lab 1 - Beginner's Luck](https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs/tree/master/Lab%201), showcasing techniques learned from the [TryHackMe Volatility Module](https://tryhackme.com/room/volatility) in a separate project series.
